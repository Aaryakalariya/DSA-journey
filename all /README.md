# DSA-journey

This repository documents my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Day 1

(Assuming you had a Day 1 entry, if not, you can start with Day 2)

## Day 2

*Topic:* Arrays / Two-Pointer Approach

*Problem:* [Move all zeros to end](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-all-zeros-to-end-of-array/) (GeeksforGeeks)

*Description:* Solved the classic "Move all zeros to end" problem. The approach used was the *two-pointer technique*, which efficiently rearranges the array in-place, moving all non-zero elements to the front while preserving their relative order, and placing all zeros at the end.

*Solution File:* move-zero-to-end.cpp

## Day 3  

*Topic:* Arrays / In-place Reversal Problem: Reverse an Array (GeeksforGeeks) Description: Implemented a function to reverse the elements of a given array in-place. This was achieved using the std::reverse function from the C++ Standard Template Library, which offers an efficient way to reverse a range of elements. Solution file: Day 3/reverse_array.cpp

## Day 4 

*Problem:* Rotate an array by d elements in counter-clockwise direction.

*Platform:* [GeeksforGeeks - Rotate Array]

*Solution Language:* C++

*Key Concepts:* Arrays, Rotation, Modulo Arithmetic

*Code File:* rotate_array.cpp

Continue adding entries for subsequent days.

## Day 5

*Problem:* Implement the next lexicographical permutation of the given array.

*Platform:* [GeeksforGeeks â€“ Next Permutation]

*Solution Language:* C++

*Key Concepts:* Arrays, Two Pointers, In-place Swap, STL, Permutations

*Code File:* next_permutation.cpp
