## Day 1

(Assuming you had a Day 1 entry, if not, you can start with Day 2)

## Day 2

*Topic:* Arrays / Two-Pointer Approach

*Problem:* [Move all zeros to end](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-all-zeros-to-end-of-array/) (GeeksforGeeks)

*Description:* Solved the classic "Move all zeros to end" problem. The approach used was the *two-pointer technique*, which efficiently rearranges the array in-place, moving all non-zero elements to the front while preserving their relative order, and placing all zeros at the end.

*Solution File:* move-zero-to-end.cpp
